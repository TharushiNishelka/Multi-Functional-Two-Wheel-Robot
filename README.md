# Multi Functional Two-Wheel Robot

Introducing our STM32-powered Two-Wheel Robot, a dynamic marvel equipped to handle diverse tasks with finesse. This compact powerhouse seamlessly executes

 -line following

 -wall following

 -color detection

 -object grabbing, pulling, and shooting

-shape and height detection of objects

 -collision avoidance, and

 -metal detection.

 With its advanced STM32 technology, this robot offers precision, versatility, and efficiency, making it an indispensable asset across various applications.

Our project, completed for the Sri Lanka Robotic Challenge 2024, achieved the honor of being selected as a finalist in the competition. Our design diligently followed the guidelines outlined in the task book provided by the competition organizers. This recognition underscores our team's dedication to precision and innovation, as well as our ability to craft solutions that excel within the parameters of rigorous competitions.
